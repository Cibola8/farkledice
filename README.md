## Overview

Farkle is a classic dice game that combines strategy and luck. Players take turns rolling six dice, aiming to accumulate points through specific combinations. The first player to reach or exceed 10,000 points wins the game.

## Gameplay

1. On your turn, roll all six dice.
2. After each roll, set aside dice that form scoring combinations.
3. You may choose to:
  - **Bank** your accumulated points and end your turn.
  - **Continue** rolling the remaining dice to try for more points.
4. If you score with all six dice, you have "hot dice" and may roll all six dice again in the same turn.
5. If at any point you roll and no scoring combinations appear, you've "Farkled" and lose all points accumulated in that turn.
